# gittranscend
gittranscend is meant to analyse git usage patterns and promote best practices of repository usage.

__*Note:*__ gittranscend is an educational exercise currently, aiming to both develop the above mentioned but in the same time allow its developers to better learn git, github and their internal ways :)
